# WKU4951 Project: ROOM
## Introduction  
In the WKU CPS4951 course, our group builds this game: ROOM. Room is a story-oriented and suspenseful game, and we want to warn people away from drugs 
with this game. In ROOM, we made a lot of metaphors about drugs. This git repository contains all the assets and scripts of our project.
The following picture is the logo of ROOM.
